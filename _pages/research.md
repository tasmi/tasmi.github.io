## Current Projects

## Doctoral Work

My doctoral work in Potsdam continued the focus on High Mountain Asia. I worked with passive microwave data to explore climate-related changes in snow cover, depth, and the timing and magnitude of snowfall seasonality. This work resulted in three papers, listed on my [Research](https://tasmi.github.io/research/) page. 

Thesis: **Smith, T** (2018) - Decadal changes in the snow regime of High Mountain Asia, 1987-2016, _Doctoral Thesis, Universit\"at Potsdam, 142. pp_. (Advisor: Bodo Bookhagen) [https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/year/2018/docId/40712](https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/year/2018/docId/40712)


## Masters Work

My Masters work at UC Santa Barbara focused on mapping glaciers in Central Asia. This resulted in one peer-reviewed publication [link](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1747-201) detailing an algorithm for semi-automatically mapping glacier outlines.

Thesis: **Smith, T (2014) - Glacial Response to Climate Change in the Tien Shan Mountain Range of Central Asia, _Masters Thesis, UC Santa Barbara, 116. pp_. (Advisor: Bodo Bookhagen) [https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3s21n2gc](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3s21n2gc)

## Undergraduate Work

My undergraduate work at Middlebury focused on two main projects: (1) mapping arsenic concentrations in Vermont, and (2) field mapping of volcanic deposits in Arizona. The arsenic work was eventually published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292711000059?via%3Dihub), and the mapping was published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027318301975). 

Thesis: **Smith, T** (2011) - Petrogenesis of Highly Evolved Rocks in the Springerville Volcanic Field, Eastern Arizona, _Bachelor Thesis, Middlebury College, 98. pp_. (Advisors: Ray Coish and Chris Condit)
