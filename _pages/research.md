My undergraduate work at Middlebury focused on two main projects: (1) mapping arsenic concentrations in Vermont, and (2) field mapping of volcanic deposits in Arizona. The arsenic work was eventually published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292711000059?via%3Dihub), and the mapping was published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027318301975).
