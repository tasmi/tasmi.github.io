## Current Projects

I am currently associated with the [ORYCS](https://www.orycs.org/) team, where my work focuses on supporting a set of field- and modelling-based ecology studies in Namibia. I am particularly interested in vegetation dynamics, soil moisture, and potential long-term changes in water availability. My work in Namibia uses a combination of in-situ and remotely sensed data. 

I am also interested in studying landscape-vegetation interactions on a larger scale -- for instance, how do feedbacks between vegetation and slope stability contribute to the long-term development of [topography](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JF005692)? For this work, I take advantage of very high resolution vegetation and topographic datasets, and use statistical techniques to study subtle signals in large and noisy datasets. 

I have several ongoing research projects based on high-resolution passive microwave data for High Mountain Asia with the goal of producing [updated estimates](https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.559175) of snow depth and changes in the cyrosphere over the past ~30 years, both following on [previous](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1701550) [methodologies](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1701550) and developing [new ones](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147363) based on novel clustering techniques for dealing with high-dimensional topographic and climatic data.

Finally, I work on understanding global-scale vegetation and ecoystem health with researchers from the [Potsdam Institude for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/home). This includes quantifying human impacts, assessing ecosystem resilience, and mapping the spatial and temporal distribution of rapid shocks such as wildfires.

## Doctoral Work

My doctoral work in Potsdam focused on the entire High Mountain Asia region. I worked with passive microwave data to explore climate-related changes in snow cover, depth, and the timing and magnitude of snowfall seasonality. This work resulted in several papers, listed on my [Publications](https://tasmi.github.io/publications/) page.

## Masters Work

My Masters work at UC Santa Barbara focused on mapping glaciers in Central Asia. This resulted in one peer-reviewed [publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1747-2015) detailing an algorithm for semi-automatically mapping glacier outlines.

## Undergraduate Work

My undergraduate work at Middlebury College (Vermont) focused on two main projects: (1) mapping arsenic concentrations in Vermont, and (2) field mapping of volcanic deposits in Arizona. The arsenic work was eventually published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292711000059?via%3Dihub), and the geologic mapping was published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027318301975).
