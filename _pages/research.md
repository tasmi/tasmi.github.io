## Current Projects

## Doctoral Work

## Masters Work

My Masters work at UC Santa Barbara focused on mapping glaciers in Central Asia. This resulted in one peer-reviewed publication [link](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1747-201) detailing an algorithm for semi-automatically mapping glacier outlines.

## Undergraduate Work

My undergraduate work at Middlebury focused on two main projects: (1) mapping arsenic concentrations in Vermont, and (2) field mapping of volcanic deposits in Arizona. The arsenic work was eventually published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292711000059?via%3Dihub), and the mapping was published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027318301975).
