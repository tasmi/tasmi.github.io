## Current Projects

My research focuses on studying how ecosystems are adapting and changing in response to climate, and what kind of feedback loops exist between [topography and natural environments](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JF005692). My recent work has focused on [assessing ecosystem resilience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01352-2) to ongoing climate shifts. This has involved the development of [new methods](https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2022-41), as well as looking at broader scale relationships between [water and vegetation](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36207-7). 

I have several ongoing research projects based on high-resolution passive microwave data for High Mountain Asia with the goal of producing [updated estimates](https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.559175) of snow depth and changes in the cyrosphere over the past ~30 years, both following on [previous](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1701550) [methodologies](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1701550) and developing [new ones](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147363) based on novel clustering techniques for dealing with high-dimensional topographic and climatic data.

I am currently running my own DFG-funded project which builds upon much of my previous work, particularly that focused on monitoring snow. The "Quantifying the Influence of Snowmelt on River Hydrology in High Mountain Asia (STRIVE)" project focuses on mapping where, when, and how water enters river systems in Nepal. This work will use a combination of GNSS-Reflectometry, satellite data, and in-situ river monitoring. 

## Doctoral Work

My doctoral work in Potsdam focused on the entire High Mountain Asia region. I worked with passive microwave data to explore climate-related changes in snow cover, depth, and the timing and magnitude of snowfall seasonality. This work resulted in several papers, listed on my [Publications](https://tasmi.github.io/publications/) page.

## Masters Work

My Masters work at UC Santa Barbara focused on mapping glaciers in Central Asia. This resulted in one peer-reviewed [publication](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1747-2015) detailing an algorithm for semi-automatically mapping glacier outlines.

## Undergraduate Work

My undergraduate work at Middlebury College (Vermont) focused on two main projects: (1) mapping arsenic concentrations in Vermont, and (2) field mapping of volcanic deposits in Arizona. The arsenic work was eventually published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883292711000059?via%3Dihub), and the geologic mapping was published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027318301975).
