**Research Themes**

My research is focused on using high spatial and temporal resolution empirical and modelled datasets to understand earth-surface processes. I am both a geologist and geographer by training, and spatial analysis plays a large role in all of my research. I am particularly interested in the impacts of short- and long-term climate changes, and feedback loops between vegetation, water, and topography. I am currently a member of the [Remote Sensing and Earth-Surface Processes](https://up-rs-esp.uni-potsdam.de/) team at the University of Potsdam. More details of my current and past research projects can be found on my [Research](https://tasmi.github.io/research/) and [Publications](https://tasmi.github.io/publications) pages.

**Teaching**

I am involved with the [Remote Sensing, geoInformation, and Visualization](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/mnfakul/studium-und-lehre/master/remote-sensing-geoinformation-and-visualization.html) Masters program at the University of Potsdam, and teach quantitative data analysis and remote sensing courses. A particular focus is on efficiently analysing very large remotely sensed datasets. I use the Python programming language extensively in my teaching and research.
