**Research Themes**
My research is focused on using high spatial and temporal resolution empirical and modelled datasets to understand earth-surface processes. I am both a geologist and geographer by training, and spatial analysis plays a large role in all of my research. I am particularly interested in the impacts of short- and long-term climate changes, and feedback loops between vegetation, water, and topography. More details of current and past research projects can be found on my [Research](https://tasmi.github.io) page.

**Scientific Background**

I obtained a BA from Middlebury College (Vermont, USA), a MA from UC Santa Barbara (California, USA) and a Doctorate from Universit&auml;t Potsdam (Germany). Details of my publications can be found on my [publications](https://tasmi.github.io/publications) page. 

**Teaching**

I am involved with the [Remote Sensing, geoInformation, and Visualization](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/mnfakul/studium-und-lehre/master/remote-sensing-geoinformation-and-visualization.html) program, and teach quantitative data analysis courses. A particular focus is on efficiently analysing very large remotely sensed datasets. I use the Python programming language extensively in my teaching and research.
