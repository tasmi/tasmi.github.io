As part of the [Remote Sensing, geoInformation, and Visualization](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/mnfakul/studium-und-lehre/master/remote-sensing-geoinformation-and-visualization.html) Masters program, I advise student theses. If you have an interesting project that you would like to collaborate on, please get in touch!
